            <p>If you're having any sort of a problem with the level pack, you can take these basic steps to troubleshoot it:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>If the Tanks game is playable, but the remote pointer isn't showing up on the screen and other animations aren't playing, this is a sign that you've downloaded the wrong version. Try using the other version and see if that fixes the issue.</li><br>
            <li>If the Tanks game is playable, but the mission titles still display as "Mission 1", "Mission 2," etc. despite the fact that you have the "Custom Titles" option set to "Enabled", you might be playing on PAL v1.00, on which custom level titles are not functioning yet. Otherwise, this is also a sign that you've downloaded the wrong version.</li><br>
            <li>If your Wii or Wii U crashes upon trying to load the first Tanks mission, try switching your Wii or Wii U's aspect ratio to 16:9.</li><br>
            <li>If your Wii or Wii U freezes on the Health and Safety screen that displays before the Wii Play title screen appears, you may have accidentally enabled ocarina codes in Riivolution. Make sure you have them disabled.</li><br>
            <li>If none of the above suggestions fix your problem and you're playing on a non-NTSC-U/PAL version of the game, your disc region is probably the issue.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If none of the above suggestions fix your problem and you <i>are</i> playing on an NA/EU version of the game, this is an unknown issue so far. In any case, feel free to contact me with details about your issue by DMing me on Discord (@kataryn) or e-mailing me (<a href="mailto:cyndifusic@gmail.com">cyndifusic@gmail.com</a>).</p>
