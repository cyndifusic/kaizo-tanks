            <p><span id="important">IMPORTANT:</span>

            <p>I can only safely say that this level pack will function on the North America (NTSC-U) release of the game. If you want to play the level pack using a disc from another region, be warned that it has not been designed for those versions or tested on those versions.</p>

            <p>Additionally, if you plan to play using a 4:3 aspect ratio (not widescreen), you must set the "Custom Titles" option to <span>DISABLED</span>; otherwise, loading Tanks will crash your console. Gib and I are working towards fixing this issue, but for now, you're going to have to play on 16:9 to view custom level titles.</p>

            <p>Finally, if for whatever reason Riivolution gives you the option to enable ocarina codes, disable them. Otherwise, the memory patches will not work correctly.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In order to play the Kaizo Tanks level pack, you will need the following tools:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a Wii or Wii U</li>
                <li>a legitimate <i>Wii Play</i> disc</li>
                <li>an SD card</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Got all that? Great! Here are the steps you'll need to take to get Kaizo Tanks up and running:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><span>Install the Homebrew Channel on your Wii/Wii U.</span> <i>(If you already have the Homebrew Channel installed, you can skip this step.)</i> If you are using a Wii, <a href="https://wii.guide/get-started" target="_blank">follow this guide</a>, and if you're using a Wii U, <a href="https://wiiu.hacks.guide/vwii-modding" target="_blank">follow this guide.</a> Once it's installed, the Homebrew Channel will allow you to run custom software from an SD card on your Wii or Wii U.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Install Riivolution on your Wii/Wii U.</span> <i>(If you already have Riivolution installed, you can skip this step.)</i> Riivolution is a piece of homebrew software that allows you to apply patches to your Wii games. You can get it <a href="http://rvlution.net/wiki/Riivolution/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Determine which version of Wii Play you have.</span> Yes, believe it or not, Nintendo released multiple versions of this game. In order to figure out which one you have, all you have to do is start up the game and look at the title screen. If the copyright date just says "2006", you are on <i>version 1.00</i>. If the copyright date says "2006-2007", you are on <i>version 1.01</i>.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Download the corresponding ZIP file to your version.</span><br><br><a href="builds/kaizotanks_rev0-c0.zip">Version 1.00 Download</a><br><a href="builds/kaizotanks_rev0-c1.zip">Version 1.01 Download</a></li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to the root of your SD card.</span> If you are asked if you want to merge folders or replace files, choose "Yes".</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Once the files finish copying, put the SD card into your Wii or Wii U, insert your Wii Play disc, start the Homebrew Channel, and then start Riivolution from there.</span> If everything works correctly, after a few moments, it should come up with a menu with two options: "Level Pack" and "Custom Titles", which are both disabled by default. Enable both of them (unless you're playing in a 4:3 aspect ratio; see the <a href="#important">note at the top of this page</a>.) Then, click Launch to start up the mod.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Start up Tanks and have fun!</span> Keep in mind that you'll need to play as a guest Mii if you don't want to write to your existing Wii Play save data.</li>

            </ol>
