  <p>Welcome! Looks like you've stumbled upon my Wii Play Tanks level pack, Kaizo Tanks. It's a work-in-progress and there are currently no public releases, so check the Updates page for progress reports on the project.</p>
  <p>The pack will have 20 levels of varying difficulties, featuring humorous twists and fun level mechanics all throughout. The best part? If you have a Wii or Wii U, a copy of Wii Play, a computer, an Internet connection, and an SD card, you'll be able to play it yourself!</p>
  <p>Special thanks to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The Goldfish King</b>, for creating extensive documentation on the formatting of Tanks game files and helping with a large texture issue</li><br>
    <li><b>GibHaltmannKill</b>, for creating Blitzkrieg Tools, a pack of Windows programs that help edit Tanks levels and level titles, and also for helping me troubleshoot issues with custom titles through his impressive Assembly knowledge</li><br>
    <li><b>JimmyKaz</b>, for answering my Wii modding questions and helping me troubleshoot, and also for helping draft Mission 3</li><br>
    <li><b>SkyArk142</b>, for supporting the pack and helping draft Mission 10</li><br/>
  </ul>
<p>This pack couldn't have been possible without these people, so a big thank you goes out to every one of them.</p>
<p>Obviously, Wii Play is property of Nintendo. The only content that belongs to me is the actual modification to the game.</p>
