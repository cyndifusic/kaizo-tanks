            <p>Welcome! I'm cyndifusic. Looks like you've stumbled upon my Wii Play Tanks level pack, Kaizo Tanks. It's a work-in-progress and there are currently no public releases, so check the Updates page for progress reports on the project.</p>
            <p>The pack will have 20 levels of varying difficulties, featuring humorous twists and fun level mechanics all throughout. The best part? If you have a Wii or Wii U, a copy of Wii Play, a computer, an Internet connection, and an SD card,
                you'll be able to play it yourself!</p>
            <div id="specialthanks">

            <p>Obviously, <i>Wii Play</i> is property of Nintendo. The only content that belongs to me is the actual modification to the game.</p>
