            <p><span>UPDATE:</span> Straight-up forgot to put this on the website for like a year but just wanted to clarify that Kaizo Tanks 2 is not going to come out. I've long since moved on from Tanks modding, but I'm grateful to have inspired so many others who have created much cooler mods than I ever could. I never thought this silly little project could have the reach that it did. Thank you all very much for your support.</p>

            <p>Welcome! I'm cyndifusic. Looks like you've stumbled upon my Wii Play Tanks level pack, Kaizo Tanks.  If you're just here to download it, head on over to the <a href="install-guide">Install Guide</a>. If you want to receive frequent updates and hang out in the Kaizo Tanks community, <a href="https://discord.gg/4qYAHZE" target="_blank">join our Discord server!</a></p>
            <p>The pack has 20 levels of varying difficulties, featuring humorous twists and fun level mechanics all throughout. The best part? If you have a Wii or Wii U, a copy of Wii Play, a computer, an Internet connection, and an SD card,
                you can play it yourself!</p>
            <div id="specialthanks">
